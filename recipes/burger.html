    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A hamburger (or simply a burger) consists of fillings—usually a patty of
      ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The
      patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles,
      bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise,
      relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island
      dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty
      topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. Under some definitions, and
      in some cultures, a hamburger is considered a sandwich.

    <p>
      Hamburgers are typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners
      but are also sold at other restaurants, including high-end establishments.
      There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers. Some
      of the largest multinational fast-food chains feature burgers as one of
      their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper have
      become global icons of American culture.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices bacon</li>
      <li>800g ground beef, chuck</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoon(s) olive oil</li>
      <li>6 slices cheddar</li>
      <li>4 burger buns</li>
      <li>4 slices tomato</li>
      <li>30g mayonnaise</li>
      <li>30g ketchup</li>
      <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the bacon in a pan. Cook over low heat until crunchy.</li>
      <li>
        Divide the meat in to 4 equal parts and VERY, very gently mold it in to
        patties, using little to almost no pressure as possible. Do not season.
        This helps them become as soft and juicy as possible. The more you press
        or squeeze the meat, the tougher and drier it will turn out!
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can season the meat with salt and pepper on both sides ….and
        that's it! Use the same pan you prepared the bacon in, without wiping it
        clean. The juice from the bacon will make the burgers even tastier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add them to the pan and very gently press on them with a spatula, just
        to flatten them a bit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle with some olive oil and cook according to your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        When they are done on the first side, flip them over and add 1 ½ slices
        of cheddar and 1 ½ slices of bacon over each patty.When they are done on

        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe down the pan with some paper towels. Add a small amount of olive
        oil and the hamburger buns. Gently press down on them with your hands
        and just heat through.Wipe down the pan with some paper towels. Add a
