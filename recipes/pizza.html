    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the
      heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or in
      traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid
      into the oven on a long paddle, called "peel", and baked directly on hot
      bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever
      the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with
      cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.[46] When made
      at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to
      reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on
      a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning
      it.[47] Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed
      outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens
      have been for centuries,[48] in order to achieve even heat distribution.
      Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly
      on a barbecue grill. Some types, such as Sicilian pizza, are baked in a
      pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven. Most restaurants
      use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their
      pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
        Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes
        until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't
        dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
        indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle
        attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing
        paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to
        medium speed using the dough hook about 7 to 10 minutes. If you don't
        have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by
        hand. The dough should be a little sticky or tacky to the touch. If it's
        too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place
        the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated
        with the oil. At this point you can choose how long you want the dough
        to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will
        result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2
        hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work
        with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the
        dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours. For a medium rise,
        place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen
        counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in
        the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours). The longer the
        rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat
        the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you
        don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking
        sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and
        push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half. Form
        2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic,
        and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to
        load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not
        crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese
        would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced
        will cover a pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten
        it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the
        center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to
        1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch
        further. Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it
        until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches. Treat the dough
        gently! You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers,
        letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of
        the dough. If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured
        surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole. Use your palm
        to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if
        you want to form a lip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of
        the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil
        (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another
        10 to 15 minutes. Repeat with the second ball of dough.Use your

        Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal.
        (The cornmeal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza
        from the pizza peel into the oven.) Transfer one prepared flattened
        dough to the pizza peel. If the dough has lost its shape in the
        transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired
        toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too
        many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.Spoon on the tomato sauce,

      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your
        hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will
        easily slide; if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a
        bit more cornmeal. Slide the pizza off the peel and onto the baking
        stone in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned
        and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward
        the end of the cooking time, you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.
